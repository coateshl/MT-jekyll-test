description: The structure we use to develop posts

In 2020, we decided to simplify our posts, including the schema, to be more accessible. 

## Core schema elements
All metrics posts contain three key sections, which are marked by the following headers:

### What it is 
Briefly and simply describes the metric. 

### How it works 
Briefly and simply reviews the metricâ€™s properties and application(s).

### What to keep in mind
Briefly and simply highlights relevant issues, limits, nuances, points of transparency, etc.

## Optional schema elements
Posts may also include the following:

### Learn more
Resources to learn more about the metric.

### Related metrics
Links to other related metrics posts (within the Metrics Toolkit)
